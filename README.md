My personal website.

## Building

You'll need the following dependencies:
```
ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

Install jekyll and bundler:
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Install gems:
```bash
bundle install
```

Build and serve locally with:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

The site should now be available at http://0.0.0.0:4000/ on your local machine, and your local machine's IP address on your networkâ€”great for testing on mobile OSes.
